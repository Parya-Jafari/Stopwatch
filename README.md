## Files structure

`src/Original.tsx` includes the code as was presented in the take-home assignment, as well as comments added explaining the bugs/issues in the code. 

`src/App-V1.tsx` is the app updated to a working condition, eliminating immediate bugs. No other changes/optimizations were made. This is to indicate how minimal changes can be made to make the buggy/broken code work (e.g. with tight deadlines, etc). 

`src/App-V2.tsx` is the modernized and optimized version of the app. Comments in this file explain more (optimizations, best practices).

The optimized version of the app is accomponied by tests, in `src/App-V2.test.tsx`.
